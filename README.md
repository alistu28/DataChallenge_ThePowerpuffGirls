# Telco Insight Hub

## Project Overview

This repository contains the codebase and documentation for the Telco Insight Hub, a project developed as part of the Data Science Weekend (DSW) 2023 event hosted by Data Science Indonesia.

## Problem Statement

1. The Telco Company is facing a high churn rate of almost 30%, a pressing issue that requires urgent attention.
2. Research by Tianpei Xu et al. shows that retaining existing customers is 5-10 times more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, underscoring the significant financial impact of a high churn rate on revenue.
3. The company struggles with not having a clear customer segmentation strategy internally, making it difficult to tailor approaches to meet customer needs.
4. Not knowing customer needs leads to ineffective treatment strategies, affecting overall customer satisfaction.
5. Internal challenges create a loop, as the absence of segmentation and customer understanding reinforces the initial problem of high churn rates.
